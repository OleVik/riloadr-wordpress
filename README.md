# Riloadr for WordPress
Forked from: <a href="https://github.com/tubalmartin/riloadr">https://github.com/tubalmartin/riloadr</a>

A cross-browser jQuery responsive images loader for WordPress (3+)

The goal of this library is to deliver optimized, contextual image sizes in responsive layouts that utilize dramatically different image sizes at different resolutions in order to improve page load time.

This modification is optimized for use with image sizes defined by WordPress via `add_image_size()`.
